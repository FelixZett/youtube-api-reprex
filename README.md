# Minimal

The YouTube API allows developers to integrate YouTube functionality into their applications, such as retrieving information on videos, channels, playlists, comments, and captions. In a TypeScript and Node.js environment, the API can be used to:

- Build custom YouTube players
- Retrieve video and channel statistics
- Search and retrieve videos, playlists and channels
- Manage and update user's own YouTube channel
- Automate video uploads and video management

Using the API in a TypeScript and Node.js environment allows for more control and customization of the YouTube experience, as well as automating tasks and improving efficiency.

## Pitfalls

You should never import the `googleapis` dependency itself. It is far too huge and will slow down your build tremendously if you are using typescript.
